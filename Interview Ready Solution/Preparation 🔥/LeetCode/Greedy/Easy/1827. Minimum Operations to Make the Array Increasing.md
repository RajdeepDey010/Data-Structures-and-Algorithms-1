# [1827\. Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-array-increasing/)

## Description

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Greedy](https://leetcode.com/tag/greedy/)


You are given an integer array `nums` (**0-indexed**). In one operation, you can choose an element of the array and increment it by `1`.

*   For example, if `nums = [1,2,3]`, you can choose to increment `nums[1]` to make `nums = [1,<u>**3**</u>,3]`.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations needed to make_ `nums` _**strictly** **increasing**._

An array `nums` is **strictly increasing** if `nums[i] < nums[i+1]` for all `0 <= i < nums.length - 1`. An array of length `1` is trivially strictly increasing.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can do the following operations:
1) Increment nums[2], so nums becomes [1,1,2].
2) Increment nums[1], so nums becomes [1,2,2].
3) Increment nums[2], so nums becomes [1,2,3].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,2,4,1]
Output: 14
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [8]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
*   1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
// Tc- O(n) Sc O(1);
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int ans =0;
        for(int i=1; i<nums.length; i++){
            if(nums[i]<=nums[i-1]){
            int temp = nums[i-1]-nums[i]+1;
            ans+=temp;
            nums[i]+=temp;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
/*
 arr[i] <= arr[i-1];
 
 1 , 1 , 1
 
 1 - 1  =0 +1 = 1;   so 1 + 1 = 2 so  -> 1 , 2 , 1
​
now  1 , 2 1 
​
2-1 = 1 + 1  = 2  so 2 +1 =3 . so -> 1 2 3
​
now array .  1 , 2 , 3 ;
we also store  1+1 = 2 and  0+1 = 1 
​
// so in that what we need do it ? to make array strickly increasing order ?
strickly increasing means no duplicate value. okay. its has to be increasing.
​
we need to return minimum operation we did while make array strickly increasing order.
so. we traverse a loop and check is current element is less then previous and equal also we will check. 
so its is smaller or equal to previous one. 
so we substract value which is different between previous and current and add one into that. bcz in question mention we need to add only 1. 
so we subtract and add one to them.
and then we also that value which we got from subtract and increasement by 1. we store into our result variable.
and now we need to change our array. to make our array stricly increasing order.
so that we what we do ? we add that diffent +1 value into our array. 
so we add that differnt_+1 value into our current elemtn index. so arr[i]+temp;
so thats things we keep doing until we reach end of the array. and finally we return minimum operation we did while making array strickly increasing order.
