# [1773\. Count Items Matching a Rule](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-items-matching-a-rule/)

## Description

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


You are given an array `items`, where each items[i] = [type<sub>i</sub>, color<sub>i</sub>, name<sub>i</sub>] describes the type, color, and name of the i<sup>th</sup> item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, `ruleKey` and `ruleValue`.

The i<sup>th</sup> item is said to match the rule if **one** of the following is true:

*   `ruleKey == "type"` and ruleValue == type<sub>i</sub>.
*   `ruleKey == "color"` and ruleValue == color<sub>i</sub>.
*   `ruleKey == "name"` and ruleValue == name<sub>i</sub>.

Return _the number of items that match the given rule_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.
```

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= items.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
*   1 <= type<sub>i</sub>.length, color<sub>i</sub>.length, name<sub>i</sub>.length, ruleValue.length <= 10
*   `ruleKey` is equal to either `"type"`, `"color"`, or `"name"`.
*   All strings consist only of lowercase letters.


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int countMatches(List<List<String>> items, String ruleKey, String ruleValue) {
        int key =0;
        int count =0;
        if(ruleKey.equals("type")) key =0;
        else if(ruleKey.equals("color")) key =1;
        else if(ruleKey.equals("name"))key=2;
        
        for(List<String>temp :items){
            if(temp.get(key).equals(ruleValue)) count++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```java
/*
            System.out.print(temp.get(key));
color key
bluesilvergold
type key
phonecomputerphone

so in that what we are doing. 

we set key value accourding to ruleKey get from function.
and if type its 0 and if its color then 1 and if its name then 2.
0 because string array or array idx start from 0.

so we set it.

now we checking if its type then checking temp.get(key) means 0 index value is eqaul to ruleValue excume RuleValue is phone so type of 0 index is phone then count increase.

so simply we check on that index same value present or not.
